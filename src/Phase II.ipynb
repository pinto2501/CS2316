    "For each inconsistency (NaN, null, duplicate values, empty strings, etc.) you discover in your datasets, write at least 2 sentences stating the significance, how you identified it, and how you handled it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nan values in columns like futures_exchangem unit, item (downloaded dataset): these missing values can break the analysis and aggregations. I identified them using df.isna().sum() and handled them by filling with specific values such as \"None\" (for most of the columns in the downloaded dataset) and \"CBOT\" for the column \"future_exchanges\" for Wheat.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inconsistent date formats (Month/Day/Year vs. Year-Month-Day) (webparser1): date mismatches can prevent a consistent time-based analysis. I standardized all dates to YYYY-MM-DD and converted them to datetime objects using pd.to_datetime().\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Blank strings in the magnitude column (webparser1): blank strings were acting like hidden NaNs, which affects calculations. I replaced empty strings with \"None\" as a string instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. float64 year columns with .0 suffix (downloaded dataset): year values were mistakenly stored as floats, which caused formatting issues. I converted them to strings and removed the trailing .0 using .replace()."
